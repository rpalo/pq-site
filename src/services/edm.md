description: We have a conventional EDM sinker, a wire EDM machine capable of burning .002" radii at least 12" deep with 5 axis motion, and a hole popper.  Our EDM services can help you with those features that you just can't machine the conventional way.

Our Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) allows us to literally *burn* away metal.  During conventional EDM, we create an electrode "positive" version of the pocket or shape to be removed out of a good conductor like copper or graphite.  Then we use that electrode to burn that shape out of the base metal.  Combining this with three axes of motion and super-accurate linear motors, it's possible to create complex geometry, threads, and even undercuts!

Our Wire EDM machines use a similar process, but using a very fine wire as the electrode instead.  If you've ever seen a hot wire cut foam, the effect is similar, but in *metal*.  This allows us to cut through almost 12 inches of metal leaving only the smallest (down to .002") radius behind. Our larger wire machine has additional "U" and "V" axes, allowing the wire to tilt in two dimensions and cut conical shapes.

These tools are ideal for prototyping long-lead-time items like extrusions and sheet metal shapes.
