In addition to the more than 30 combined years of manufacturing, design, and design-for-manufacturing experience we have, we also have a full suite of software tools to help us visualize, lay out, and assemble systems virtually before we cut a single chip.  This helps us find issues, interferences, and solve problems before beginning the more expensive build process.

We have a Certified SolidWorks Expert on staff to assist you with any tricky CAD issues, and we can also provide support with Finite Element Analyses (FEA) and Computational Flow Dynamics (CFD).  Our team also specializes in complex and computation-intensive design calculations.  We can even build you software tools to help you get your designs done faster.

We're happy to sit down with you -- or give you a tour of the shop! -- and provide initial consultation, so that you can get a feel for what we're looking for and what problems we see that will cause your designs to be expensive or difficult to machine or mold.  Contact us today and send us your designs, and we'll get you on the right track!
