During conventional EDM, we create an electrode "positive" version of the pocket or shape\n    to be removed out of a good conductor like copper or graphite.  Then we use that electrode to burn that\n    shape out of the base metal.  Combining this with three axes of motion and super-accurate linear motors,\n    it\'s possible to create complex geometry, threads, and even undercuts!<p>\n    <p>Our Wire EDM machines use a similar process, but using a very fine wire as the electrode instead.  If you\'ve\n    ever seen a hot wire cut foam, the effect is similar, but in <em>metal</em>.  This allows us to cut through\n    almost 12 inches of metal leaving only the smallest (down to .002") radius behind. Our larger wire machine has\n    additional "U" and "V" axes, allowing the wire to tilt in two dimensions and cut conical shapes.</p>\n    <p>These tools are ideal for prototyping long-lead-time items like extrusions and sheet metal shapes.',logo:"/images/edm-icon.svg",images:["/images/wire1.png","/images/wire2.png","/images/wire3.png"]},engineering:{title:"Engineering Support &amp; Consulting",description:"<p>In addition to the more than 30 combined years of manufacturing, design, and\n    design-for-manufacturing experience we have, we also have a full suite of software tools to help us visualize,\n    lay out, and assemble systems virtually before we cut a single chip.
